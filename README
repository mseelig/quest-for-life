Crowdsourcing the Drake Equation

I have implemented basic functionality of the survey charts which displays data
for each combination of parameter, age group and gender. There are a number of
improvements that could be made:

1. Use Ajax to update charts when chaging select fields. This is better implemented
   in Rails 3 with its built-in support for UJS.
2. Preserve age group and gender selections when changing parameters.
3. Separating the Javascript from the html using an include.
4. Using haml for the erb file.
5. Highlighting user data in the charts.
6. More unit and functional tests.
